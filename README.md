# Fake_face_detection
This project aims to develop an efficient fake face detection system using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and the **VGG16 model**. The system will distinguish between real and manipulated facial images, addressing the growing concern of image and video manipulation in the digital era. By training on a diverse dataset of real and fake faces, the CNN and VGG16 model will learn intricate features to accurately classify and differentiate between authentic and manipulated images.
